# Veriga

This is an [Angular project](https://veriga.web.app/) created by Ahmet Ustun for the SoftUni Angular exam.

"Veriga" is a project which aims to show us that money travels long distances, meets new people and becomes a part of their stories.

All logged-in users with a stampted bill can leave a story that can be read by other people until next time that bill is discovered.

## All Users

In the website, all users can visit:

### `Home`

In the Home page, a very brief explanation about the project is given.

Logged-out users will be redirected here.

There is a button that changes behaviour depending on the user status.

### `Wiki`

Users will be able to check the Bulgarian bills from the 99 collection.

### `Wiki - Details`

If details are needed about a specific bill, there is a embed sidebar.

### `About`

Users can know more about me and in case, they can get my social links.

## Logged-in Users

In the website, only logged-in users can visit:

### `User`

Only logged-in users are able to enter a bill.

Each bill has ability to remove an older story.
